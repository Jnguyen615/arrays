> **Self Evaluation** 

>I spent some extra time going over arrays just to get a better understanding of how they work. I feel confident about them and using them within my own code. The methods were a little trickier to get down, but after practice I'm feeling confident about those as well. 

> The boolean arrays were a little harder to figure out, but after some research I managed to get it and get it to work. I practiced a lot so I feel ready to move on, and I'll always have my notes and the previous work to reference for help.
